# RODYGOSSET.DEV

This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for my personal portfolio.  
It is [statically generated](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation), and all the data and media I'm using can be found in this repository.

## FEATURES

If you want to learn from how I integrated and implemented this project,  
check out the [How It's Made]() page on the website

The website is structured internally to support several languages.  
For now, only English and French are available.

## TECH STACK

Here's the list of technologies and libraries I've used  
to bring my ideas to life:
